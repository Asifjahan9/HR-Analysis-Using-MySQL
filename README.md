# HR-Analysis-Using-MySQL
In this project I have analyzed the data of HR using SQL Queries to gain valuable insights.



HR analysis using MySQL typically involves extracting and analyzing data from various tables in an HR (Human Resources) database. This could include employee details, payroll data, attendance records, performance reviews, and more. By running SQL queries, you can gain valuable insights into the workforce, employee performance, payroll management, and trends related to employee retention, training, and recruitment.
